// You are given an array/list ARR consisting of N integers. Your task is to find all the distinct triplets present in the 
// array which adds up to a given number K.

// An array is said to have a triplet {ARR[i], ARR[j], ARR[k]} with sum = 'K' if there exists three indices i, j and k 
// such that i!=j, j!=k and i!=j and ARR[i] + ARR[j] + ARR[k] = 'K'.
